                Surprisingly efficient, but don't expect me to throw a party over it.
                I'll admit it's slightly better than doing it myself â€“ which is like saying a root canal is slightly 
                better than a kick in the teeth."

                "As an emperor, I've learned the value of delegation and efficiency. This application, designed to
                arrange the clearing of snow, embodies these principles well. It harnesses the potential of human 
                cooperation for a communal benefit. However, I must reflect on the importance of personal 
                endeavor and hardship in shaping character. While the service is commendable for its utility
                and effectiveness, it should not replace the virtues gained through facing nature's challenges 
                oneself."
